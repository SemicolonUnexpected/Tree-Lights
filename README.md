# Leafscript üå≤

Leafscript is a interpreted language with native support for tree-lights.
It is easy to learn and understand.

Get started [here](https://github.com/juleswhi/leafscript)

# Raspberry Pi ü•ß

+ The RPi runs a C# Websocket server, which clients can connect to and send animations to ( and individual frames! )
+ The server will then take those animations and map them to the tree

## Lighting üå©Ô∏è

+ Probably need a high light density - Matt Parker had a 6-7 ft tree with **500** LEDs
+ Curved surface area of a cone = **œÄr¬≤l**
+ Optimal light density - A lighting calc can be found [here](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/interiors/a38498712/christmas-tree-lights-baubles-calculator/), but most websites recommend **100 lights per 2ft of tree**
+ At least 300 lights, preferably 500
+ How many lights do we want IN the tree compared to the amount on outside of tree
+ Use less lights and do half the tree
+ Imaging lights - need after school or multiple lunchtimes to get it right

## C# libraries üìò

+ Emgu - This library is used pinpoint the tree lights
+ Adafriut - Neopixel - To manipulate the tree lights

## Electronics üîå

+ [Video of how to wire the pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJupt2LIjp4) 
+ The video uses the following method. Wiring with only a female adapter and jumper wires

+ Wiring the pi with a chip

+ Wiring the pi with a diode

+ 0.3W / LED
+ Wiring multiple strips

+ Indian guys who sound like they know what they are doing can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OB2-H-jiJM), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnapNHn-Ge0)
+ A high ampage power supply will be required for daisy chaining the LEDs or each set of 50 can be provided with its own power supply

## Light Show üî¶

+ A couple minutes of preset animations - show stopper - maybe use external non-tree lights - people talk about tree - more people see tree - ooga booga bish bash bosh Tree 2 electric boogaloo I am become Tree pine needeler of school
+ Obnoxious Carol Of the Bells
+ Get someone from maths to come up with cool mathematical function to use on tree
+ Use precomputed animations

## C# API

+ An API which allows users to programatically display effects to the tree.
+ Technical documentation about the API can be found [here](https://github.com/Friends-Robotics/Tree-Lights/blob/main/docs/API.md)

## Minecraft üß±

+ Minecraft implemented with the Tree Lights!
+ You can "draw" an image with some blocks in minecraft and get it to show up on the tree!
+ A full guide to getting it setup can be found [here](https://github.com/Friends-Robotics/Tree-Lights/blob/main/docs/Minecraft.md)

## Fun Features 

+ Code competition for who can make the best code using the API?
+ GUI client where you can create animations or switch on off invididual lights
